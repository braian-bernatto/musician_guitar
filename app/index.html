    <h1>Diego Bogar√≠n</h1>
    <h2>Guitar/ Bass /Editing</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Diego Bogarin, I have more than five years of experience recording guitar and bass professionally, appearing on bands alongside acclaimed musicians in the Rock/Metal genre such as Adrian Benegas (Tragul, Solo), Herbie Langhans (Avantasia, Firewind), Alex Holzwarth (Rhapsody), Ralf Sheepers (Primal Fear) and more. My main goal is to create guitar or bass parts that will serve the writer's vision and enhace the song, focusing on the technique, feel, groove and attitude the song needs to effectively tell it's story. My roots are in Classic Rock and Metal but I have branched out from there to Pop and Pop Rock and I'm open to record songs in new genres. I also have several years of experience editing guitars, bass, drums and vocal tracks, from quantizing to pitch correction or whatever your track needs, working with the best tools on the industry. Feel free to reach out with any questions- I'm looking forward to making some music with you!</p>
